    <h1 class="title">Testing</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Adhering to best practices</h2>
    <p>
        The first step in order to ensure the best outcome of testing is making sure xdebug is installed and activated.
        Neoan3 installs with PHPunit and has a phpunit.xml set up accordingly.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle has-margin">Creating tests</h2>
    <p>
        Test-classes are expected to be within the respective component or model. You can use the cli-tool to create these files.
    </p>
    <p><code>neoan3 new test &lt;component|model> &lt;name></code></p>
    <p>
        The tool is smart enough to guess the differences between types of components (e.g. api or route) and suggests test-methods accordingly.
        In some cases the tests can be completely generated for you.
    </p>
    <p class="has-margin">
        What this means is best understood by simply trying it out: generate a new route component with: <br>
        <code>neoan3 new component example -t:route -v:yes -f:demo</code> and create a test for the component with <br>
        <code>neoan3 new test component example</code> <br><br>
        You should have the following in file /component/Example/ExampleTest.php
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="code-block">
            &lt?php

            namespace Neoan3\Component\Example;

            use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

            class ExampleTest extends TestCase
            {
                private Example $instance;
                function setUp(): void
                {
                    $this->instance = new ExampleController();
                }

                public function testInit()
                {
                    $this->expectOutputRegex('/^&lt!doctype html>/');
                    $this->instance->init();
                }

            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="has-margin">
        In this simple example the tool identifies that the component is a route component and tests that the output starts with the
        doctype declaration, ensuring that there are no errors thrown or headers printed.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle has-margin">Running tests</h2>
    <p>
        The easiest way is to run <code>neoan3 test</code>, which will execute all tests and (if xdebug is available), create a coverage report in
        /tests.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle has-margin">Mocking</h2>
    <p>
        Since the introduction of providers, mocking has become easier and mocking database transactions, filesystem and authentication methods has become easy.
        In order to explore capabilities, simply create a test for an existing model and inspect how the database is tested.
        Please be advised that your frame has to support dependency injection of a database provider in order to mock components that use models.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title has-margin">Continuous Integration</h2>
    <p>
        Neoan3 ships with a .travis.yml which resolves build-testing with php 7.4 and reporting to code-climate for quality, velocity and test-coverage evaluation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle has-margin">Using Travis CI & Code Climate</h2>
    <p>
        The recommended workflow for setting up these tools is to
    </p>
    <ul class="has-margin">
        <li>1. Share your project on GitHub</li>
        <li>2. Add your repository to codeclimate</li>
        <li>3. Retrieve your Test Reporter ID for the repository from codeclimate</li>
        <li>4. Add your repository to Travis-CI</li>
        <li>5. Add your Test Reporter ID as an environment variable to your repo on Travis-CI (CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once these steps are completed, every pull request on your repository on GitHub should trigger a build-process. (Don't forget your badges ;-) )</p>
