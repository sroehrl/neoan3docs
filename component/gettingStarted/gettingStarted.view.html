                Re-usability, maintainability, modularity and abstraction are only a couple of the terms heard when we
                talk about frameworks.
                But where is the line between strict formats for rapid development and flexibility to bring freedom?<br>
                Once learned, neoan3 delivers the possibility to develop <strong>very efficient and fast</strong>
                without losing flexibility.

                <div style="display: block">
                    <p class="subtitle has-margin">
                        Quick start:
                    </p>
                    <div class="select">
                        <select id="quick-start">
                            <option disabled selected>I want to build...</option>
                            <option value="api">An API</option>
                            <option value="classic">A server side rendered website</option>
                        </select>
                    </div>

    <h2 class="title">Targeted audience</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Power to the people</p>
    <p>
        Specialization into designers, front-end-, back-end-developers and SysOps has offered benefits to the industry.
        However, not only is it common for smaller to medium sized projects to have only a hand full of resources at
        their disposal,
        the separation itself often endangers productivity if "one hand does not know what the other does". <br>
        neoan3 inhabits all of these worlds, but mostly centers around one simple idea:
        <strong>One component's front- and back-end is handled by one full-stack artist.</strong>
        This does not mean that collaboration is limited. neoan3 can be a single-page application or a pure backend-api with ease.
        It merely means that it is crafted for the <strong>one who does it all</strong> in mind. <br><br>

    </p>
    <h2 class="title">Interested?</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Then let's jump into details</p>
    <p>
        neoan3 is intended for Apache and NGINX and works closely with concepts of the modern web (including JS-modules
        & custom elements).<br>
        The result is a true all purpose framework for the full stack developer. <br>
        Development of modular functionality is done in components. These components contain view and controller
        functionality -
        in the case of hybrid components this means JS & PHP controllers. <br>
        Models are kept separately to provide an easier security layer on data. <br><br>
        This sounds a little strange? Worry not, it will make so much more sense soon ...
